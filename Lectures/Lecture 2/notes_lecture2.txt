    .update() - takes another dictionary as input and adds it to another dictonary
    .keys() - access the keys , good to use in for loops


For Loops
    range(lens(variable)) - get length of a list/dictionary to determine how many times to run


Variables

Python recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. 
For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.
