Comparisons
===============
>       greater than
>=      greather than or equal to
<       less than
<=      less than or equal to
==      eqaulity (comparing left and right
=       assignment (right to left)
!=      not equal to



Comparison: if

if the answer is true:
    then execute code for me...

if <>:
    xx
elif:
    yy
else:
    zz

Program is not designed well even through its correct
- Too many repetitive (if this, if this, if this,...)
- Always asking X (num_ifs) questions
- How to ask less ifs iterativly is "elif"
- Dont need the last "elif", just need "else"


# if x % 2 == 0:
#     print("Number is even")
# else:
#     print("Number is odd")
    
main():


Question if you define your own function? canyou use  ".split()" or ".title()"
only if its a stirng! Depends on your object type (str, int, bool, etc.)
