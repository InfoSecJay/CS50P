Notes
=======================

print(*objects, sep=" ", end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)    

- everything between () is a parameter
- the inputs of the parameters are the arguments
- *objects means the function can take any number of arguments
- sep=" " means the seperator, whn you pass multiple arguments, they are seperated by a space
- end='\n' means every line ends with a new line
- file and flush not discussed in lecture
- can use double or single quotes, same thing!
- escape strings with "\"
