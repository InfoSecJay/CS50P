"""
In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date,
anno Domini, in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636,
wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:[dict]

Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the userâ€™s input is not a valid
date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more
than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
