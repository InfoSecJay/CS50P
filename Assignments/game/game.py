"""
In a file called game.py, implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates an integer between 1 and , inclusive, using the random module.
Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.
- If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
- If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
- If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.
