sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Between sort1 and sort2, we know bubble sort performs better when the list is in order and sort1 performs much faster on a sorted list than sort2.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Merge sort is the fastest algorithm (O(nlogn)) out of the three and the sum of run times across all files was the lowest for 'sort2'.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: I identified sort2 to be Merge sort and sort1 to be bubble sort, so by order of elimination.
